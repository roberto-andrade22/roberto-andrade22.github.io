**PV Parks in dump designated territories: A business opportunity**
<br><br>
This project downloaded ten years of climate data from Copernicus –the European Union Earth observatory– for two very different countries regarding their amount of sunlight: Spain and Germany, to obtain the energy potential of installing PV panels on land with a land-use designation such as *dump*. The project objective is to
- Demonstrate that such output is big enough to be financially viable and successful.
- That the total production is consistent from year to year.
