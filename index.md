**PV Parks in dump designated territories: A business opportunity**
<br><br>
This project downloaded ten years of climate data from Copernicus –the European Union Earth observatory– for two very different countries regarding their amount of sunlight: Spain and Germany, to obtain the energy potential of installing PV panels on land with a land-use designation such as *dump*. The project objective is to
* Demonstrate that such output is big enough to be financially viable and successful.
* That the total production is consistent from year to year.

**Predicting the next items in a grocery ordering & delivering app**
<br><br>
Given Instacart's open source dataset, 3 million Instacart Orders, in which there is information of millions of sales transactions that have been made through the app, it is of interest to try to answer some questions regarding hidden patterns within the data.

The purpose of this project is to answer at least one of the questions: Which item will the user add to the basket next?
